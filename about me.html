<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm currently on my journey to become a full-stack web developer. I haven't always been into programming or tech as a matter of fact. When I was in college, I was the type to jump from major to major.
I guess you can say I was testing the water in all these different fields. I spent the bulk of my time at college as a sustainability major. Though I was passionate about the field, I found it hard to make a living with it. My family always wanted me to puruse something a little more "practical" like accounting or human resources, but I couldn't see myself doing that.</p>
<p>I honestly still don't know what my calling is, but after taking a few online courses and giving my web development projects a go, it's all that's been on my mind lately. I've been obessessed with it lately and cant wait to see how things play out.
 Well this introduction is turning more into a journel entry, so let's get straight to the point.</p>
